## Iterations/Sprints/Deliverables

```text
º Respect the deadlines;
º Reach out by Wednesday with your questions about the work for the week;
º Hand-in on Saturdays till 12:00.
```

## Communication

```text
º Check your Slack daily;
º Transparency;
º Create Slack channel for your team;
º Use Slack channel Class05 for help (use mentions appropriately: @channel (probably not), 
  @here, @name @class05);
º Communicate with your team/team mate;
º Share knowledge with your team/team mate;
º Frequent communication with your team mate;
º Github communication.
```

## Git flow/Pull requests

```text
º Share code, even small changes (and work-in-progress);
º Using tools like GitHub to share code;
º Review each others code;
º Use GitHub;
º GitHub pull request for everything.
```

We respect deadlines.

We check communication platforms daily and respond as soon as it is realistic.

We strive to keep communication both in terms of code and teamwork as transparent as possible, so we ask on open channels on Slack and contribute often to GitHub - even work-in-progress code.

We use Github to share code and we always use pull requests and don't merge any code without at least one approved review.

There will be one main repository for the project which will be forked by one student from each group. The other students contribute to the fork and are welcome to "fork the fork", but it is suggested not doing this until the project is finished as to avoid confusion.

## Team working agreement

```text
º Commitment - Agree on a clear number of hours a week.
```

## Backlog/Task management

```text
º Split and agree the work load;
º Staying in the scope of the given tasks;
º To-do list in the scope;
º Use Trello;
º Use Github Issues;
º Use Troll/Scrum;
º Use Agile;
º Hand-in on Saturdays till 12:00.
```

## Physical meetings

```text
º Have frequent meetings;
º Meeting to discuss the requirements;
º Meet face to face outside of class;
º Communicate frequently and do share screen sessions;
º Meet up to your group partner;
º We set a goal for how many hours a week we work and try to respect that.
  If you are delayed or need to skip a class or be absent from group work we
  make sure to notify the team members on Slack within reasonable time.
```

We meet physically each week to work together and catch up on progress.

We do a "daily standup" as a Slack message, physical meeting or Slack call where we notify team members about progress the previous day and what we plan to do the current day (even if nothing) as well as coordinate any dependencies between the tasks we are working on.

We agree on using a tool to maintain our backlog of pending work.

We delegate work, but make sure that everyone have some knowledge of all code that gets merged.

We strive to build the product according to the specification, but without wasting time on over-engineering or gold-plating features.
